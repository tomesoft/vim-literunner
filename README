Title: liteRunner Vim plugin
Version: 0.4
Description: Supports Edit-Run-Edit cycle of your scripting
Author: Junichi OKADOME <tome@tomesoft.net>


Concept:
 Edit,Run,Edit cycle is a very essential work for software development.
 Shebang (#!...) in your editing file is an explicit directive to run them.
 Why not use it? It's effective more than any other complex settings.
 liteRunner plugin supports your Edit,Run,Edit cycle simply.


Installation:
 a). with vimball "liteRunner.vba" 
     TODO: Prepare URL
     If you got a vimball, do a typical way;
        $ vim liteRunner.vba
        $ :so %

 b). from GitHub
     You can get a newer version of liteRunner plugin from;
        git://github.com/tomesoft/vim-literunner.git
     with git clone command
        $ cd ~/.vim/bundle
        $ git clone git://github.com/tomesoft/vim-literunner.git
        $ cd vim-literunner
    Then copy stuffs into ~/.vim (on Windows, %USERPROFILE%\vimfiles)
    or make a new vimball, see the chapter 'Making Vimball'


Usage:
 General mode <Leader>g, <Leader>G
 1. In editing your script, key-in <Leader>g (in default, <Leader> mapped
    to backslash '\') runs your script and the result is shown in output window.
 2. If you need to pass some command line arguments when run it, key-in
    <Leader>G, then cusor jumps into command line like;
     :LRRunscript 
    input arguments (e.g. --help) and key-in return to run with the
    arguments.
     :LRRunscript --help
    (is evaluated like as /usr/bin/env python myscript.py --help)
 3. The specified arguments (in Step 2) are held (in buffer locally), and that
    will be re-used on next run with <Leader>g until change them (using
    <Leader>G) or finish editing.

 Interactive mode <Leader>i, <Leader>I
 1. If you already installed ConqueTerm plugin (see http://code.google.com/p/conque),
    can run in Interactive mode. <Leader>i opens a terminal with (hopefully) a REPL,
    and if available a selection (in vim visual mode) , pass them to that terminal.
 2. To specify a REPL program, use <Leader>I. Command line will be shown as; 
     :LRRunRepl /usr/bin/env ruby
    These are current setting (getting from shebang or something), and you can rewrite
    to the line like;
     :LRRunRepl /usr/bin/env irb
    then key-in return to run that command line for interactive mode.
    Once it is specified, that value is held in variable b:REPL, and will re-use
    until change it.
 3. When an interactive (REPL running) terminal opened, select lines in editing buffer
    via visual mode (v, V or Ctrl-V) then key-in <Leader>i, the selection will be
    passed into the REPL (and it will be evaluated).


Customization:
 1. Key Mappings
    You can change mappings, as you like;
    :noremap <Leader>g :LRRunScriptWithHeldArguments<CR>
    :noremap <Leader>G :<C-\>e("LRRunScript " . liteRunner#ExpandHeldScriptArguments())<CR>

    for Interactive mode (required ConqueTerm plugin)
    :noremap <Leader>i :LRRunScriptInteractively<CR>
    :nnoremap <Leader>I :<C-\>e("LRRunRepl " . liteRunner#ExpandRepl())<CR>
   
 2. Variables
    Some variables are for customization, their prefix is g:liteRunner_XXX.
    - g:liteRunner_tries_to_use_shebang=1 (bool=0,1)
        A flag means whether to use Shebang or not.
        When set to 0, uses entry of g:liteRunner_ftyps_cmds_dict.
    - g:liteRunner_uses_quickfix_on_error=1 (bool=0,1)
        A flag means whether to use quickfix or not on error
    - g:liteRunner_shows_quickfix_on_error=1 (bool=0,1)
        A flag whether show quickfix (with :cope) or not.
    - g:liteRunner_checks_errors_always=0 (bool=0,1)
        A flag wheter check errors (include exitcode==0) or not.
    - g:liteRunner_windowheight_default=5 (num)
        Default (initial) height of the output window. A Number of output
        lines are greater than the hight, the window height will be resized
        up to g:liteRunner_windowheight_max
    - g:liteRunner_windowheight_max=10 (num)
        Maximum height of the output window. A Number of output lines
        are greater than the height, the window height will be resized
        up to this value.
    - g:liteRunner_ftyps_cmds_dict={dict of defaults} (dict)
        Dictionary, contains entries of filetype and respoinding commands.
        That is used when not use Shebang (no Shebang in editing content or
        g:liteRunner_tries_to_use_shebang set to 0).
        Format of an entry;
        'ruby' : ['/usr/bin/env ruby', '/usr/bin/env irb']
        Key is a filetype, confirms with :echo &filetype.
        Value is list of command lines, index=0 is for Generic mode,
        and index=1 is for Interactive mode (optional).
        It is better to use function liteRunner#UpdateFtypsCmdsEntry(),
        to add/replace a part of entry (not whole dictionary).
    - g:liteRunner_prognames_efms_dict={dict of defaults} (dict)
        Dictionary, contains entries of program name and responding error formats.
        When a program exited with error code (not 0), check to contain specific
        errors in its output.
        Format of an entry;
        'python' : [
                \ '%A\ \ File\ \"%f\"\\,\ line\ %l',
                \ '%A\ \ File\ \"%f\"\\,\ line\ %l\\,\ %m',
                \ '%-C\ \ %p^',
                \ '%+C\ \ \ \ %s',
                \ '%+C%*[^\ :]%trror:\ %m',
                \]
        Key is a program name, e.g. python, ruby, gosh, ...
        Value is a list of element of errorformat, eventually join with ','
        then set to errorformat.
        It is better to use function liteRunner#UpdatePrognamesEfmsEntry(),
        to add/replace a part of entry (not whole dictionary).

    For Interactive mode
    - g:liteRunner_ConqueTerm_command='ConqueTermSplit'
        Command is to open a terminal window in interactive mode.
    - g:liteRunner_ConqueTerm_renew_everytime=0
        A flag means whether renew terminal window everytime or not.
    - g:liteRunner_ConqueTerm_content_pass_mode=1
        Mode value means how pass a content to terminal,
        0=never pass, 1=selection only, 2=entire of content.

 3. There are some functions for customize, their prefix is liteRunner#XXX
    - liteRunner#UpdateFtypsCmdsEntry(key, value)
      see the variable g:liteRunner_ftyps_cmds_dict
    - liteRunner#UpdatePrognamesEfmsEntry(key, value)
      see the variable g:liteRunner_prognames_efms_dict
